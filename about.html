                        <p>
                            Hello! My name is Bhawna Sirohi, and I’m a multi-skilled tech enthusiast with a strong
                            passion for combining technology and creativity. With a dynamic background in web
                            development, graphic designing, and Java programming, I aim to create digital solutions that
                            are not only visually appealing but also robust, functional, and scalable. I believe in
                            building things that make a difference—websites that engage, designs that inspire, and
                            applications that solve real-world problems. </p>

                            <p>
                            From a young age, I was always fascinated by how technology works. This curiosity led me
                            into the world of programming, design, and development. Over the years, I have refined my
                            skills through continuous learning and hands-on experience in various projects. Today, I
                            confidently manage end-to-end processes in both design and development. </p>

                            <p>
                            As a Web Developer, I specialize in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and frontend frameworks like
                            React.js and Bootstrap. I build responsive and user-centric websites that perform smoothly
                            on all devices. I also integrate backend technologies when needed, ensuring seamless
                            communication between the client and server sides. Whether it’s an e-commerce website or a
                            portfolio, I enjoy turning ideas into reality on the web. </p>

                            <p>
                            In parallel, I work as a Graphic Designer, where I bring creativity to life. Using tools
                            like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Canva, I design engaging logos, banners, social media
                            posts, and full user interfaces. My design work is rooted in strong visual
                            principles—balance, contrast, typography, and color theory—to ensure every piece of work is
                            not just attractive but also aligned with the brand’s message. </p>

                            <p>
                            Beyond the web and visuals, I have strong technical expertise as a Java Developer. I have
                            developed object-oriented Java applications for desktop and web platforms. My experience
                            includes working with frameworks like Spring and handling backend logic, API integration,
                            and problem-solving using Java’s robust features. I follow clean code principles and always
                            strive to write efficient and maintainable code. </p>

                            <p>
                            To support both development and application performance, I have hands-on experience with
                            databases such as MySQL, Oracle, and MongoDB. I can design and structure databases, write
                            optimized queries, and ensure data integrity and security. Whether it’s creating a database
                            for a blog site or integrating a complex data structure into a Java backend, I handle it
                            confidently. </p>

                            <p>
                            What sets me apart is my ability to bridge the gap between visual design and functional
                            development. I enjoy wearing multiple hats—designer, developer, and database handler—all to
                            build complete solutions that users love and businesses need. </p>

                           <p>
                            I’m always open to learning new tools, collaborating with others, and taking on new
                            challenges. Whether working on a solo project or as part of a team, I bring dedication,
                            creativity, and problem-solving skills to the table. My goal is simple: to keep growing and
                            to create digital experiences that leave a lasting impact.
